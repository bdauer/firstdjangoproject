Just following along with the official django tutorial from here:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/

You can find my notes in [notes.md](https://github.com/bdauer/firstdjangoproject/blob/master/notes.md)

The notes are meant as a quick reference for myself when working with django.


Notable differences:
* The Table of Contents differs from the official tut's ToC.
* In some places I've added additional references to the official documentation. In many other places I haven't included references to the official docs.
* The ordering varies. I make reference to related concerns that occur in other parts of the tutorial.
* Explanations have been removed, reworded, or shortened.
* I draw occasional parallels to flask or peewee ORM.
* In a few places where code went through multiple iterations it has been combined.
* I include a link to my commit before adding generic views to help see the changes made.
